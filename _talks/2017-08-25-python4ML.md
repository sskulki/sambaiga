The talk is part of [pythontz](https://pythontz.github.io/) events and aims to give an accessible introduction to how to use machine learning techniques using [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) for your own projects and datasets.[Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is a Python open source library designed to tackle machine learning problems from beginning to end. It provides efficient versions of a large number of common machine learning algorithms.

The talk covered the following aspects:

1. [Introduction to scikit-learn](https://github.com/neylicious/python4MachineLearning-NMAIST/blob/master/notebook/Part%201-Introduction%20to%20sklearn.ipynb)
2. [Data-preprocessing](https://github.com/neylicious/python4MachineLearning-NMAIST/blob/master/notebook/Part%202-Practical%20Machine%20Learning%20with%20Sklearn.ipynb)
3. [Feature engineering](https://github.com/neylicious/python4MachineLearning-NMAIST/blob/master/notebook/Part%203-Feature%20Selection%20and%20Model%20Selection.ipynb)
4. [Model tuning and evaluation](https://github.com/neylicious/python4MachineLearning-NMAIST/blob/master/notebook/Part%204-Modeltuning%20and%20Evaluation.ipynb)
