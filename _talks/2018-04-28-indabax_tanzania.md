Pythontz in collaboration with the University of Dodoma, College of Informatics and Virtual Education with support from Indaba Africa, organised a four days Indaba X Tanzania Deep learning workshop that brought together more than 40 participants. As one of the workshop facilitator, I gave tutorial  and lead lab sessions on basics of python for machine learning and data science research, machine learning fundamentals, foundation of deep learning and deep learning for computer vision. 

[The basics of python for machine learning and data science research](https://github.com/sambaiga/PytzMLS2018/tree/master/Python%20for%20ML%20and%20DS) was a three hours lab session aimed at presenting the basic concepts of python programming and how to use the language, with several readily-available open-source libraries for machine learning and data science. Participants were able to learn the basics of python and how to use it to perform numerical computing, analyse data, create beautiful visualizations, process image and implement machine learning algorithms.

[Machine learning fundamentals](https://github.com/sambaiga/PytzMLS2018/blob/master/slides/ML-foundation-one.pdf) introduced the fundamental of machine learning with emphasis on enabling participants to learn how to build remarkable machine learning algorithms capable of solving complex real-world problem. Participants were able to  understand the basics of machine learning, its applications and learn how to formulate supervised learning problem.The tutorial also explore different challenges of machine learning algorithms and discuss best practise for evaluating machine learning algorithms.

[Foundation of deep learning](https://github.com/sambaiga/PytzMLS2018/blob/master/slides/ML-foundation-two.pdf) tutorial presented the foundations principles of deep learning from both theoretical and implementation perspective.Specifically participants were able to understand the basic building block of deep learning model, modern deep learning architectures and their application and how to train deep learning algorithms with emphasis on techniques used in practise to train these algorithms. Further participants managed to learn how to implement machine learning and deep learning algorithms using [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) framework.

The last tutorial session focused on [deep learning techniques applicable to images](https://github.com/sambaiga/PytzMLS2018/blob/master/slides/Deep_vision_seq.pdf). It present  the basic concepts of Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), transfer learning and how to build and train CNN models using Pytorch framework.
