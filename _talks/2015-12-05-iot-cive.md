The evolution of communication technologies is bringing Internet connection to devices at lower cost, less power consumption and smaller sizes, making devices able to be parts of the so called Internet of Thingsâ€™: a global network of smart devices that can sense and interact with their environment using internet for their communication and interaction. Arduino is an incredibly flexible micro-controller and development environment that cannot only be used to control devices, but can also be used to read data from all kinds of sensors. Its simplicity and extensibility, in addition to its great success and adoption by users, has led to the development of a variety of hardware extensions and software libraries that enable wired and wireless communication with the Internet. It is an ideal open hardware platform for experimenting with the world of the Internet of Things. This is a four week course providing hands-on experience with how connected devices and the Internet of Things work. The training will provide you with all the information you need to design and create your own Internet of Things (IoT) applications using the Arduino platform.

**Specifically, the workshop aimed at enabling participants to learn**:

- About the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing concepts
- The basic usage of Arduino environment for creating embedded projects at low cost
- How to create IoT application using Atmel (AtMega 168 and or328) AVR microcontroller with Arduino bootloader.
- How to connect Arduino directly to the Internet and talk to the Cloud
- How to reprogram Arduino microcontroller remotely through the Cloud
