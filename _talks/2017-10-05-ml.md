As part of pythontz events, I had an opportunity to present a talk on foundations of machine learning and deep learning at the University of Dodoma (CIVE). The talk introduces the basic of machine learning with a focus on supervised learning (classification and regression). It further presents the basic of deep learning, research direction, and opportunities for machine learning and deep learning in developing countries. It lastly presents different open source python libraries and frameworks for machine learning and deep learning. The presentation for this talk can be found [here](https://speakerdeck.com/sambaiga/foundation-of-machine-learning-and-deep-learning).
