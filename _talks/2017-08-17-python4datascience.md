Python is a powerful, flexible, open source and widely-used programming language with many applications.
I had an opportunity to facilitate a workshop on python4Data science at Arusha Technical College (ATC), Arusha -Tanzania. The workshop aimed to explores Pythonâ€™s place in the scientific ecosystem, and how the language, with several readily-available open-source libraries, can serve as a powerful tool for data science. 

The workshop covered the following aspects:

1. [A thorough introduction to python programming](https://github.com/neylicious/python4datascience-atc/blob/master/presentation/Python4DS.pdf).
2. Introduction to scientific computing with [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/).
3. Data Analysis and Data Visulisation with [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).
4. Introduction to Machine Learning.

To demonstrate the power of python for data-science we used the following datasets from Tanzania [opendata portal](http://opendata.go.tz): [Primary School Enrolment by Sex and Age](http://opendata.go.tz/dataset/primary-school-enrolment-by-sex-and-age) and [University Students Enrollment Degree & Non-Degree](http://opendata.go.tz/dataset/udahili-wa-wanafunzi-wa-vyuo-vikuu-ngazi-ya-shahada-na-isiyokuwa-shahada-2015-2016)

All resources for this workshop can be accessed [here](https://github.com/neylicious/python4MachineLearning-NMAIST).
