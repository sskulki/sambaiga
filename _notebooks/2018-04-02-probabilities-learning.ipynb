    "Given some data $ \\mathbf{x}=[x_1\\ldots x_m]$  that come from some probability density function characterized by\n",
    "an unknown parameter $ \\theta$. How can we find $ \\hat{\\theta}$  that is the best estimator of $ \\theta$. For example suppose we have flipped a particular coin $ 100$  times and landed head $ N_H = 55$  times and tails $ N_T = 45$  times. We are interested to know what is the probability that it will come-up head if we flip it again. In this case the behavior of the coin can be summerized with parameter  $ \\theta$  the probability that a flip land head (H), which in this case is independent and identically distributed Bernoulli distribution. The key question is, how do we find parameter  $ \\hat{\\theta}$  of this distribution that fits the data. This is called parameter estimation, in which three approaches can be used:\n",

Take an example if we flipped  a coin twice and $N_H = 2$, the MLE of $\\theta$, the probability of H would be $1$. This imply that we are considering it impossible for the coin to come up T.
