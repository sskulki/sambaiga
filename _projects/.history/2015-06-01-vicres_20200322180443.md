  Water Resources Governance System (WaGoSy)
---

The project developed innovative and integrated solutions for Governance of Water Resources within Lake Victoria Basin named as Water Resources Governance System (WaGoSy).
WaGoSy is an integrated and innovative ICT system designed to enhance participation,transparency, accountability and awareness among LVB water resources stakeholders, which
are typical indicators of good governance. The system provides effective, efficient and timely means for communication, knowledge creation.
and sharing, reporting and feedback mechanisms. I lead the team that developed Wireless Sensors and Mobile Sensing Platform for Governance of Water Resources within Lake Victoria Basin. It consists of Water Quality Reporter (WaGoSy-WQR) which capture and send water quality data to a central database via mobile phones, WSN which gives the WaGoSy ability to test water quality parameters at selected sensitive sites continuously.

Field testing of the system was conducted in Nkokonjero, Uganda and Mwanza, verified the functionalities of the system and its practical application in actual environment.
