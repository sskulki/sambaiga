Monitoring of end-use appliances energy consumption plays an essential role in the design of customized energy efficiency and energy demand management strategies. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) proposes an attractive and cost-effective option for appliance energy monitoring by analyzing aggregate energy consumption monitored from a single point source.

Unlike the traditional approach, which requires deploying sensing infrastructure for each appliance in buildings, the NILM technique is cost-effective, non-intrusive, and can be easily integrated into buildings. A NILM system often consists of the following main steps; **feature extraction and representation**, **appliance recognition**, and **energy estimation**. This project aims to:
1. Develop robust feature representation for appliance classification in high-sampling resolution NILM.
2. Develop robust energy estimation techniques for low-resolution NILM.
3. Explore multilabel-learning for appliance classification in NILM.
