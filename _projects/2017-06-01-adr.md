Through a user centered and agile software development methods, this project has developed an Adverse Reaction Reporting System (ADR).  The ADR system provides features (mobile and web-based) for healthcare professionals and consumers to voluntarily report issues regarding quality of medical drugs, medication errors and adverse reactions.  Furthermore the system allows TFDA to receive and perform causality assessment on the reported cases. The ADR system has also implemented the data exchange standard provided by the WHO to automate the submission of the ADR reports from TFDA to WHO.
The ADR Reporting System can be downloaded at Google Play Store as [TFDA ADR Reporting Tool](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cive.HakikiDawaADR&hl=en) and installed on android smart phone. The web-based application can be accessed at [here](http://www.tfda.go.tz/adr/).
