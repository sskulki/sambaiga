<p><strong>Specifically, the workshop aimed at enabling participants to learn</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>About the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing concepts</li>
  <li>The basic usage of Arduino environment for creating embedded projects at low cost</li>
  <li>How to create IoT application using Atmel (AtMega 168 and or328) AVR microcontroller with Arduino bootloader.</li>
  <li>How to connect Arduino directly to the Internet and talk to the Cloud</li>
  <li>How to reprogram Arduino microcontroller remotely through the Cloud</li>
